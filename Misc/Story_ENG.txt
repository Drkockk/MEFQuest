> Start
Ercan Korkut has declared the program of 'Yetmez Gencler' mandatory for the all students of MEF University.

His plans were unpredictable; he wanted both students and instructors to become his puppets.

He has manipulated everyone with brainwashing videos of 'Yetmez Gencler'.


One day Ercan noticed a unexpected outlier. One of the students were not watching the videos...

When he tried reaching out to that student it was already too late for him, Ms Yılmaz have already figured out Ercan's plans.

Ms. Yılmaz has reached to the student before Ercan could. She told him about devilish plans of Ercan and he was the only one left who could stop him.


Ms. Yılmaz managed to stay unaffected by the videos because she noticed the true purposes of them. However, Ercan was aware of who watched those videos and who didn't.

Noticing that Ms. Yılmaz manage to resist the brainwashing videos, he set out to capture her and succeeded.

By the time you arrive at to the campus almost all studens and personel has been converted into mindless zombies.

Accepting the sitation you're in, you approach the gates of the campus.

(Fight)


Player: Are you working with them? This is madness! Students are acting like brainless zombies. 

Office Worker 1: It was his idea... Ercan Korkut... We brainwashed the students with Yetmez Gençler videos.

Player: And why did he need to do this exactly?

Office Worker 2: His ambition... He believed that MEF University was the most successful one at graduating competent students. He wanted all others to respect that belief...

Office Worker 1: He brainwashed everyone to make them believe it as well. So he get other to join MEF in the future without any hangups.

Player: Brain washing people is not a solution to this! How can I end this madness?

Office Worker 2: He is on 5th floor. Defeat him... He is still giving Yetmez Gençler courses.

*Player starts walking off to take stairs.*


Office Worker 1: Wait! You can't defeat him, you are still weak!

Player: Do you know something?

Office Worker 1: Aye, according to the ancient legends, there is only one person who knows how to defeat him.

Player: And who is that?

Office Worker 1: I'm telling you "ancient legends" right? There is a book of his learnings in the library.

Office Worker 2: The book is guarded by someone who resides in the library. You need to be careful.

> Another encounter with the toaster guy.

Toaster Guy: How is going? Have you found a way?

Toaster Guy: Nice, in any case if you need this *offers a pizza toast*

Player: Thanks man.

Player: (This should be the library, looks like it's being guarded.)

Player: Can I pass through? I need a book for my reasearch project.

MC: That was my favorite book back in my freshman days.

MC: He was such a good man, I wonder why the things turned out like this.

*MC finds a marked page, only thing written on that page is 'Use the power of Math'

MC: Oh, I should have attended the calculus classes...

MC: Anyways, let's keep going.

-----------------------------

>MC gets back to the stairs, realizes that 4th floor's on upstairs is destroyed. 

MC: (A great plan, he doesn't let me go up. Stairs cannot be used and the elevator was not working when I checked it last. I will see if I can do anything.)

>Go back on 3rd Floor
>Check the destroyed stairs.

>Go back on 3rd Floor
>Check the destroyed stairs..

>Go back on 3rd Floor

->Minigame

>MC manages to repair the elevator somehow and goes up on 5th floor. 
>Ercan Korkut greets him as his arms were crossed, let's him get out of the elevator.

E: Ah... Finally I have found you. It was such a surprise such a failure like you could reach here. But it ends here I fear.
E: You should have left this Campus and never came back. But its too late for you now. I'll make sure that you will join the others after I defeat you.

*MC kept his cool at Ercan's intimidating demeanor.*

MC: You are poisoned by the power granted you by the people who have trusted you!
MC: You have turned all the students, all the professors into your puppets.
MC: Today your reign of manipulation will end, I will end it.

Ercan: You? Are you going to do that all by yourself? Don't be so silly now.
Ercan: You are just another small error in my system, and I will fix it.

MC: You should have educated people not turning them into brainwashed zombies. I was a big fan of your works, your efforts on making people go beyond their true potentials.
MC: And you underestimate your student professor. I have found it. I foudn the ancient texts hidden in the depths of the library!

Ercan: So you did it. You really entered the forbidden room. It won't change a thing anyway. Enough talking, let's end this.

Fight starts


Ercan: What did I do... This program has taken over me.

Ercan: Instead of brainwashing young people, I should have educated them.

Ercan: How did you realize what was happening?

MC: Buse teacher, told me everything before being captured.

MC: Thanks to her, I wasn't affected by anything.

MC: It's not too late to correct what you have done.

MC: How can we fix the students?

Ercan: We can fix the students with a program called ‘Yetkin-Gencler.’

Muhammer: You will never be able to stop me. It's too late now...

MC and Ercan: ???

Muhammer: It's time to face me.

The fight begins, and MC loses.

MC: He's too powerful for me...

Ercan: I know how to defeat him... Take this...

MC: Huh? Is this a calculator?

MC: Why didn't I think of this eariler...


Fight

Muhammer Kartal faints.

MC takes the key from Muhammer.

Buse: I knew you could do it. You deserve to get a full credit from the project.

They rescue Buse from the room and board the shuttle to leave.

Muhammet Sahin becomes the new rector of MEF University.

Ercan changes his name to Erhan and establishes the 'Yetkin-Gencler' program.

The campus issue at MEF remains unresolved.
