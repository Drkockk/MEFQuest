MEF QUEST title screen


> Start
Ercan Korkut has declared the program of 'Yetmez Gencler' mandatory for the all students of MEF University.

His plans were unpredictable; he wanted both students and instructors to become his puppets.

He has manipulated everyone with brainwashing videos of 'Yetmez Gencler'.


One day Ercan noticed a unexpected outlier. One of the students were not watching the videos...

When he tried reaching out to that student it was already too late for him, Ms Yılmaz have already figured out Ercan's plans.

Ms. Yılmaz has reached to the student before Ercan could. She told him about devilish plans of Ercan and he was the only one left who could stop him.


Ms. Yılmaz managed to stay unaffected by the videos because she noticed the true purposes of them. However, Ercan was aware of who watched those videos and who didn't.

Noticing that Ms. Yılmaz manage to resist the brainwashing videos, he set out to capture her and succeeded.

By the time you arrive at to the campus almost all studens and personel has been converted into mindless zombies.

Accepting the sitation you're in, you approach the gates of the campus.

Students are blocking the way go upstairs.

Student 1: Where is the C Block by the way?

Student 2: I don't really know, I was going to ask you where is dining hall.

*MC approaches to them*

Player: Hey, are you guys alright?

Student 1: What is it to you, get lost!

Student 1: Where am I?

Student 2: The last thing I remember is we were watching "Yetmez Gençler"'s video...

Player: Yeah, you and all the other students were getting manipulated by Professor Ercan Korkut.

Student 1: No way...

Player: I'm surprised that you don't remember a thing.

Student 2: I told you man, last thing I remember is we were watching "Yetmez Gencler"'s course video.

Student 1: Now that you mention it.. Where are all the other students?

Student 2: Wait wait! We are late for Calculus Class!

-------------

> Someone hears commotion outside and approaches you.

Ilkay: Hey! You three over there! What are you all up to? You're supposed to be in class!

Student 1: Sorry but instead of attending class most people are learning calculus by watching 'Buders Bogaziciliden'. They really don't need your classes.

Ilkay: How dare you?! I will make sure they will fail the class!

*fight starts*

(During the fight Ilkay: "This theorem is well known!" "You are so predictable, your moves are well known!" "No calculators! This is a math class, you're the calculator")

>Ilkay has defeated and his mind became to normal

Player: Are you alright professor?

Ilkay: Where am I, 'guys'?

Player: Ercan has brainwashed everyone. We have to catch him. But I don't know where he is.

Ilkay: As I remember he is hiding in 5th floor.

Player: I have to stop him at any cost!

> 2nd floor (Prep floor)

You see a few prep students
>They talk with such a broken accent and english
+School good but school no has campus.
-Ama UNIQ var kanka.
MC: Haven't you told, it's forbidden here talking in turkish?!
(fight sırasında I don't now diyebilir öğrenciler)

+What happening!?!?!
MC: What did happen to you? 
-We did watched videos and went .
MC: (It's really exhausting to try talking with those guys in English, most probably I might find something useful in Registrar Office.

MC went into office and personals realised that he didn't get affected. 
+(How comes he is still thinking on his own?!)
+Haven't you attended Yetmez Gençler? You won't be able graduate.
MC: Cut the crap, where is Professor Korkut?
+We can't inform you about that topic, you may mail us later.
MC: Really?
+Yeah.
(fight sırasında You may mail us, we can't help you right now, diyebilirler)

*fight*


MC: How have you done this all? This is madness! Students are acting like brainless zombies. 
+It was his idea... Ercan Korkut... We brainwashed the students with Yetmez Gençler videos.
MC: And why did he need to do this exactly?
+His ambition... He believed that MEF University was the most successful one at graduating students as competent. He wanted all others to respect that belief...
+He brainwashed everyone to make them believe it as well. So he could make other participants as MEF Students in the future without any hangup.
MC: People should have their own choices. They should decide on their own! How can I end this madness?
+He is on 5th floor. Defeat him... He is still giving Yetmez Gençler courses.

MC starts walking off to take stairs.


+Wait! You can't defeat him, you are still weak!
MC: Do you know something?
+Aye, according to ancient legends, there is only one person who knows how to defeat him.
MC: And who is that?
+I'm telling you "ancient legends" right? Most probably he is dead already. But there is a book of his learnings in the library.
+Anyways the book is guarded by someone. You need to be careful.
MC:(Is that someone our librarian? I knew the time would come someday. I shall pay a visit to library.
MC: Take care.

MC takes upstairs.

MC: (God, that was close...)

> Another encounter with the toaster guy.
+How is going? Have you found a way?
MC: Aye, I got some intel, I should find a kind of ancient information at Library to defeat him. 
+Nice, in any case if you need this *offers a pizza toast*
MC: Thanks man.


>Eventually MC gets to library.
The librarian is waiting in fron of the door, guarding there.
MC: May I pass through, I need a book for reasearch purposes.
+No one is allowed unless you get permission by Professor Korkut. Do you any signed paper?
MC:Nah.
+Then you can't pass through.
MC: We will see about that.

+Ugh... I feel dizzy, what happened to me?
MC: Professor Korkut is manipulating everyone in the school. 
MC: I need some help now. I should gather some information to stop him. Will you help me.
+You talk about the forbiedden part of the library I guess. It has 3 different corridors. THe information you need should be there.

MC: I don't really need that book now.


3rd book; Egitim Sizde Sistem Caresiz by Ercan Korkut

MC: That was my favorite book back in my first class days.
MC: He was such a good man, I wonder why the things turned out like this.

*MC finds a marked page, only thing written on that page is 'Use power of the Math'

MC: Anyways, let's keep going.

-----------------------------

>MC gets back to the stairs, realizes that 4th floor's on upstairs is destroyed. 

MC: (A great plan, he doesn't let me go up. Stairs cannot be used and the elevator was not working when I checked it last. I will see if I can do anything.)

>Go back on 3rd Floor
>Check the destroyed stairs.

>MC gets closer to elevator and stare at it for a while, he/she gets a few necessary items from electric lab and tries to repair it.

->Minigame

>MC manages to repair the elevator somehow and goes up on 5th floor. 
>Ercan Korkut greets him as his arms were crossed, let's him get out of the elevator.

E: Ah... Finally I have found you. It was such a surprise that a failure like you could reach 'till here. But it ends here I fear.
E: You should have left this Campus and never come back. It's too late for regretting things tho. I'll make sure that you will be joined the others after I defeat you.

*MC kept his cool at Ercan's intimidating demeanor.*

MC: You are poisoned by the power grantedd you by the people who have trusted you!
MC: You have turned all the students, all the professors into your puppets.
MC: Today your reign of manipulation will end, I will end it.

Ercan: You? Will you do that by all yourself? And how exactly? Don't be so silly now.
Ercan: You are just another small error in my system. I will fix it.

MC: You should have educated people not turning them into brainwashed zombies. I was a big fan of your works, your efforts on making people go beyond their true potentials.
MC: And you underestimate your student professor. I have found it. I read your secret book in the library. I will use the power of MATH.

Ercan: So you did it. You really entered the forbidden room. It won't change a thing anyways. Enough talking, let's en-

*His words cutted off by MC*

MC: Your time is runnig out!

Fight starts

Ercan: OMG What did i do... This program has taken over me.
Ercan: Instead of brainwashing young people, I should have educated them.
Ercan: How did you realize what was happening?
MC: Buse teacher, told me everything before being captured.
MC: Thanks to that, I wasn't affected by anything.
MC: It's not too late to correct what you have done.
MC: How can we fix the students?
Ercan: We can fix the students with a program called ‘Yetkin-Gencler.’
Muhammer: You will never be able to stop me. It's too late now...
MC and Ercan: ???
Muhammer: It's time to face me.
The fight begins, and MC loses.
MC: He's too powerful for me...
Ercan: I know how to defeat him... Use mathematics.
MC: Huh??? Are you serious?
MC: Bruh. What does math have to do with anything?
